# Advent of Code

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. To
run the code for a given puzzle, place your input file in an `input`
directory inside a year directory, with a name showing which day it's
for, like `2024/input/day-01.txt`. Then run (for this example) `make
2024-01-1`.
